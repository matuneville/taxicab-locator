# Taxicabs Locator üèôüöï
Given the cabs coordinates and it's driver's names in a .JSON file which can be real-time updated, taxi data is uploaded, sorted by distance in km. Project developed in VSCode.

## Step by Step üìë
To begin with, I need the coordinates of some taxicabs in a specific area. I asked the AI language model [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) to fill the `cabsCoords.json` file with the coordinates of seven random taxis around Manhattan, from Central Park to the south, within a 4 km radius. ChatGPT also provided the names of the drivers and gave me my coordinates at the intersection of Broadway and W 30th St.

```json
{
"your_coordinates": {
     "latitude": 40.74682811843807, 
     "longitude": -73.98848619172874 },
"drivers": [
      { "name": "John Smith", "latitude": 40.74771308973833, "longitude": -73.97877709492026 },
      ...
      { "name": "William Wang", "latitude": 40.74083180050023, "longitude": -74.00535973627026 }
    ]
  }
```

Following, I got the data transfered into arrays and dictionaries in orden to apply the algorithms that calculate the geographic distance in kilometers between my coordinates and the taxis'.  

After that, the calculated data is written into the output .JSON file, being uploaded in an ascending distance sort, so to know which is the closest driver.

```json
{
 "taxicabs": [
  { "name": "John Smith", "distance": 0.8238008665967854 },
  { "name": "Michael Davis", "distance": 1.1391259008548733 },
  ...
  { "name": "David Kim", "distance": 3.4481215635639435 }
 ]
}
```
This is how we can know how far away are the given taxis from where we are standing. Below you can see that the distances measured in Google Maps to some drivers are correctly calculated with the program.

## Haversine Algorithm üåê
The Haversine Formula allows you to determine the spherical distance between two points on a spheric surface given their longitudes and latitudes. Having converted the variables to radians, the Haversine Formula is applied:

```python
  dlat = lat2 - lat1
  dlon = lon2 - lon1
  a = sin(dlat/2)**2 + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin(dlon/2)**2
  c = 2 * asin(sqrt(a))
  r = 6371 # Radius of the Earth in kilometers
  distance = c * r
    
return distance
```
